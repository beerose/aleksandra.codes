This project uses Markdown for formatting text. I've embedded the Markdown
[Cheat Sheet] below, so you can see how it's styled, and what features are
supported.

This Markdown cheat sheet provides a quick overview of all the Markdown syntax
elements. It can’t cover every edge case, so if you need more information about
any of these elements, refer to the reference guides for
[basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) and
[extended syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax).

## Basic Syntax

These are the elements outlined in John Gruber’s original design document. All
Markdown applications support these elements.

### Heading

# H1

## H2

### H3

### Bold

Here's some **bold text** in a sentence.

### Italic

How about some _italicized text_?

### Bold & Italic

If you really want to emphasize something, try **_bold and italic text_**.

### Blockquote

<figure>

> There is no value in anything until it is finished.

<figcaption>
  —Genghis Khan, about my side projects
</figcaption>
</figure>

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Unordered List

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

## Extended Syntax

These elements extend the basic syntax by adding additional features. Not all
Markdown applications support these elements.

}
```

### Strikethrough

~~I didn't mean to say this.~~

### Task List

### Heading ID — ❌ unsupported

Curly braces in MDX escape to JavaScript, so they can't be used to assign ids.

```md
### My Great Heading {#custom-id}
```

Use JSX instead

```jsx
<h1 id="custom-id">My Great Heading</h1>
```

### Emoji — ❌ unsupported

```
That is so funny! :joy:
```

Use your system emoji picker instead.

### Highlight — ❌ unsupported

I need to highlight these ==very important words==.

### Subscript

H~2~O

### Superscript

X^2^
