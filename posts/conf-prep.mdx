  Some thoughts on how I prep for conferences. It's a 5-week process I've been
  tweaking over time. Not saying it's the ultimate guide, but it's been working
  for me. Maybe it'll help someone else out there too. Dive in if you're
  curious!

No one really asked for this, but I'm sharing it anyway.

I've been trying to get better at preparing my conference talks. More effective.
Less overwhelmed. I think I've finally figured out a process that keeps me
organized and helps me feel like I'm on top of things. It's _not_ the ultimate
guide, but it's been working for me. Maybe it'll help someone else out there
too.

I typically begin five weeks in advance when preparing for a new talk. This
isn't set in stone. The exact timeline may vary depending on the topic and if I
have other presentations to prepare at the same time. Or other bigger projects
to attend. Like a vacation üèñ. Though, I try to stick to these five weeks as my
process has five stages: research, content, narration, slides, and dry runs.
I do this to ensure I always find the time for each. Sometimes it's difficult,
considering I prepare most of the talks in my free time and try to have a social
life outside of work. A full week gives me room to adjust if unexpected life
stuff or my day job shuffle things around. In reality, I work approx 8 hours/week per
talk.

I use [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/) extensively. I use it to brain
dump all my notes and thoughts and figure out the narration of my presentation.
I also use it to visualize _deadlines_ üëá

## Research

If I have more time, I spend more than a week researching. It's the creative
part, so sometimes it doesn't really feel like work. It's also difficult to
estimate how much time it takes, as it's a very unstructured time when I can go
in different directions and play with ideas. It consists of the following:

- _Just_ thinking
- Talking to people
- Playing with projects/tools
- **Tons** of reading
- **Tons** of googling
- More thinking
- More talking to people

Once I'm done, my FigJam looks like this:

## Content

For that part, I reserve one week, which usually means 4-20 hours of work,
depending on the talk. I combine everything from the research step into
something that makes sense. I filter all my notes and collect what I can
actually use (disclaimer: it's usually 5% of everything I came up with during
the research phase). If I need to create a demo app, that's the time. It's time
to ensure that everything I want to show is ready.

My FigJam is usually more organized after this stage:

## Narration

Again ‚Äî one week and usually 4-8 hours. This phase means writing the script,
figuring out the flow, and sometimes adjusting the content. I keep rearranging
cards in Figma into something that makes sense. Then I go over it in my head (or
at loud), and if that doesn't make sense, I rearrange it again. And again. Until
I'm happy or until I face the theoretical deadline I put upon myself. I keep the
narration flow in FigJam but write the script in Google Docs or Dropbox Paper.

Here are some examples:

## Slides

One week, ‚àû hours (as there's always something to improve, but also, I love this
part). Once the narration is ready and I know what to say, I can make slides **from
the narration**. That's important. Not the other way around. If I start with
slides, I'd either rely on them too much or would need to redo them from scratch
after writing the script. Slides are the addition, not the central part. Slides
should enhance this narrative, not dictate it. I'll keep repeating that ‚Äî
**Don't do slides before narration**. And believe me, I stared with slides many
times in the past, and every single time I was highly frustrated and unsatisfied
with my talks afterwards.

## Dry runs

I usually start a few days before the talk; this phase often overlaps with the
previous one. Though, I didn't master that one yet. I always tell myself I'll do
many of them but end up with 2-3 at most. My goal is to do one per day one week
before the conference.

Of course, it could be better, and I procrastinate, push deadlines, etc. But
this process lets me ensure I deliver the talk and what's important ‚Äî ** I worry
about one thing at a time**. That's a lot of stress that you can get rid of. I
don't have to think about slides for the first few weeks. Similarly, I don't
worry about the narration or the flow during the first phases. And when I'm
doing the narration, I don't worry about the content because that phase is done.
It used to be overwhelming to focus on everything at once. Knowing that I have
dedicated time in my calendar to stress about a particular thing can make the
present way more enjoyable.
