All [`<aside>`][aside] elements in MDX are rendered on the right side of the
paragraph before them on wide screens.

I've stolen the idea, obviously. The main inspiration was the side note rendered
in a second column on [Paco Coursey's website][paco].

<aside>The [MDN example][aside] of `aside` presents a similar idea.</aside>

Paco has used `position: absolute` in his implementation, and that's very
elegant and simple, but it has one tiny problem. On narrow screens, you end up
with the sidenote _above_ the content, and in a left-to-right language, we'd
expect what's on _right_ to go _below_ when it's no room for it on the side.

I couldn't think of a pure-CSS solution, so this is ~~overengineered~~
implemented with a rehype plugin. We grab the nearest previous sibling of an
`aside`, and wrap them both in a flexbox container.

<style>{`
  /* tiny tweak to ensure screenshotted text is not mistaken with written text */
  html:not(.dark) img {
    border: 1px solid rgb(229 229 229);
  }
`}</style>

To be clear, Paco's website is beautiful, and the [post][paco] I screenshotted
states an intentional goal of **simplicity** in its design. It would be a bit
disingenuous if he traversed the AST just to position the sidenote. This
project, for better or worse, is&nbsp;free of such constraints.
