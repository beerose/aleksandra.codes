### Question 1: What is NaN?

```js
typeof NaN; // ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
```

Correct answer: `number`.

#### Explanation

*NaN* (Not a Number) belongs to numeric data types. It's used for unrepresentable, undefined, or missing values. *NaN* was specified in [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) floating-point standard over 35 years ago.
In the [ECMAScript](https://tc39.es/) standard *Numbers* are actually represented as IEEE 754 floats.

This is how NaN looks in floating-point (32-bit) precision: **s 111 1111 1xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx**. The exponent of NaN is filled with 1s.

### Question 2: Is string a String?

```js
"wtf" instanceof String; // ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
```

Correct answer: `false`.

#### Explanation

In JavaScript everything is an _object_ except for primitives: _string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined_, and _symbol_. The **instanceof** operator doesn't work with primitives (works only with objects), so it returns **false** for a primitive value **"wtf"**. For primitives we're using _typeof_.

---

### Question 3: Arrays comparison

```js
[] == ![]; // ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
```

Correct answer: `true`.

#### Explanation

Let's take it step by step, starting with the right-hand side expression.

1. Empty array is _truthy_ in JavaScript. In other words *Boolean([])* is *true*.
2. The **!** operator is defined for boolean values only, so when applied to nonboolean value, JavaScript will automatically coerce it into a boolean. As **[]** is truthy, **![]** results in **false**.
3. Based on 1. and 2., we can replace the right-hand side expression with **false**, so we now need to consider: **[] == false**.
5. In this kind of comparison (object type and boolean type), JavaScript will convert values into numeric ones.([The Abstract Relational Comparison Algorithm](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.8.5))
6. **[]** is coerced to **0**, and **false** is also coerced to **0**, thus **0 == 0** is true.

### Question 4: Prototypes and global variables

```js
Object.prototype.wtf = "wtf";
console.log(wtf); // ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
```

Correct answer: "wtf" will be printed to the console.

#### Explanation

JavaScript is [_prototypal_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain) object oriented language. As *window* is an object, you can find *Object.prototype* in window's prototype chain.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 100%">
  <div style="text-align: center; width: 800px">
    <img src="/content/js-quiz/windowobject.png"/>
  </div>
</div>

In the code from the question, we set variable **"wtf"** to _Object.prototype_. In JavaScript, global variables are read from *window* but if *window* doesn't have its own **wtf** property, JavaScript traverses _window_'s prototype chain to find **wtf**.

What's more ‚Äî now almost everything has **"wtf"** property üôÉ

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 100%">
  <div style="text-align: center; width: 600px">
    <img src="/content/js-quiz/allwtf.png"/>
  </div>
</div>

### Question 5: Octal numbers

```js
const num = 02020;
console.log(num); // ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
```

Correct answer: `1040`

#### Explanation

In JavaScript (as well as in other programming languages) [octal (base-8)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal) numbers start from 0.

2020 = (2 √ó 8¬≥) + (0 √ó 8¬≤) + (2 √ó 8¬π) + (0 √ó 8‚Å∞) = 1040

---

### Question 6: Min value

```js
Number.MIN_VALUE > 0; // ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
```

Correct answer: `true`.

#### Explanation

**Number.MIN_VALUE** is a very small, but a positive number ‚Äî **5e-324**.

---

### Question 7: Binary vs unary plus

```js
"foo" + +"bar"; // ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
```

Correct answer: `fooNaN`.

##### Explanation

As we have double *+*, the first one is a standard binary addition, but the second one is an [unary plus](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Unary_plus).

In other words we can read the above code as: **foo + (+"bar")**.

The unary plus applied to **"bar"** will try to coerce it to number. However **"bar"** is not a number or numeric string, so it's instead converted to NaN.

---

### Question 8: Number prototype

```js
(1) === 1; // true
Number.prototype.isOne = (function () {
  return this === 1;
})

(1).isOne(); // ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
```

Correct answer: `false`.

#### Explanation

I don't know üôÉ

My guess would be that *this* is a boxed **reference** to a number, so what happens here is a comparison by reference.

The code below results in *true*, which possibly can mean that *this* needed to be coerced to number in order to perform a comparison by value.

```js
Number.prototype.isOne = function () { return this - 1 === 0; }

(1).isOne();
```

### Question 9: arrrrays wtf

```js
++[[]][+[]]; // ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
```

Correct answer: `1`.

#### Explanation

This one is well explained by [John Resig](https://twitter.com/jeresig) on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1154338).

### Question 10: constructor[constructor][constructor]

```js
const WTF = "constructor";
WTF[WTF][WTF]("alert('wtf')")();
```

Correct answer: Alert with text "wtf" pops up in your browser.

#### Explanation

Let's break it into smaller pieces and substitute **WTF** with **"constructor"**.

1. **WTF[WTF]** becomes **constructor['constructor']**. As *window* has its own **constructor** and global variables are read from _window_, we can easily access it. Now, the *constructor* of a *constructor*  is a **Function**
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 100%">
  <div style="text-align: center; width: 400px">
    <img src="/content/js-quiz/constr.png"/>
  </div>
</div>

2. **Function['constructor']** is a **Function**. We could have one "WTF" less or five more if we wanted.
3. Function called with a string creates a function with the body being this string. And then, the trailing parentheses **()** call the function, evaluating **"alert('wtf')"**.

> [MDN Docs on Function's constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function):
>
> Calling the constructor directly can create functions dynamically but suffers from security and similar (but far less significant) performance issues to eval. However, unlike eval, the Function constructor creates functions that execute in the global scope only.

### Question 11: Calling toString() on a number

```js
5.toString(); // Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token
5..toString(); // ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
```

Correct answer: `"5"`

#### Explanation

Firstly, why is **5.toString()** a syntax error? It's because JavaScript expects numbers followed by a dot to be floats.

**5.** itself is a valid floating point literal and it's interpreted as **5.0**. Thus executing **5.0.toString()** works just fine.

---

####Question 12: parseInt in base-24

```js
parseInt(null, 24); // ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
```

Correct answer: `23`

#### Explanation

The digits for base 24 are: **0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f, ..., n**.

*parseInt(null, 24)* is equivalent to *parseInt("null", 24)*, as JavaScript will convert the first argument to string.

Starting from the left-hand side of string **"null"**, the first digit **n** is 23rd digit in base-24. The next digit ‚Äî **u** ‚Äî is invalid (does not occur in base-24), so the rest of the string is ignored, and 23 is being returned.

---

### Question 13: Math.min vs Math.max

```js
Math.min() < Math.max(); // ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
```

Correct answer: `false`

#### Explanation

```js
Math.max(); // -Infinity
Math.min(); // Infinity
```

Therefore **Infinity < - Infinity** results in false.

---

### Question 14: Parsing "Infinity" in base-24

```js
parseInt("Infinity", 24); // ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
```

Correct answer: `151176378`

#### Explanation

The digits for base-24 are: **0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f, ..., n**.

Let's look at **Infinity**'s letters as base-24 numbers:

```sh
i: 18
n: 23
f: 15
i: 18
n: 23
i: 18
t: invalid, does not occur in base-24
y: ignored, as a previous digit was invalid
```

Now we need to convert it with base-24:

151176378 = 18 * 24^0 + 23 * 24^1 + 15 * 24^2 + 18 * 24^3 + 23 * 24^4 + 18 * 24^5

```js
[18, 23, 18, 15, 23, 18].reduce((acc, n, i) => acc + n * 24 ** i, 0);

> 151176378
```

### Question 15: Join on a sparse array

```js
[, , ,].join(); // ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
```

Correct answer: `",,"`

#### Explanation

**[, , ,]** is an array of length 3:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 100%">
  <div style="text-align: center; width: 300px">
    <img src="/content/js-quiz/array.png"/>
  </div>
</div>


Join by default uses a comma as a separator, and as we have a 3-elements array, the last comma is stripped as a trailing one, so the result is **",,"**.

---

### Question 16: Local storage

```js
localStorage[0] = undefined;
if (localStorage[0]) {
  console.log("wtf");
}
```

Correct answer: Will print "wtf" in your console

#### Explanation

Local storage only accepts string values, so when we set **localStorage[0]**, to **undefined**, it's converted to a string ‚Äî **"undefined"**.

---

#### Question 17: document.all

```js
typeof document.all[0]; // object
typeof document.all; // ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
```

Correct answer: `undefined`

#### Explanation

For this one, let's look at the [HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-dom-interfaces.html#the-htmlallcollection-interface:dom-document-all).

> The *all* attribute must return an HTMLAllCollection rooted at the Document node, whose filter matches all elements.
>
> The object returned for all has several unusual behaviors:
>
> 1.  The _ToBoolean_ abstract operation in JavaScript returns false when given objects implementing the HTMLAllCollection interface.
>
> 2.  The _Abstract Equality Comparison_ algorithm, when given objects implementing the HTMLAllCollection interface, returns true when compared to the undefined and null values. (Comparisons using the Strict Equality Comparison algorithm, and Abstract Equality comparisons to other values such as strings or objects, are unaffected.)
>
> 3.  **The typeof operator in JavaScript returns the string "undefined" when applied to objects implementing the HTMLAllCollection interface.**

The _unusual_ behavior that we're seeing in this example is the last one.

The rationale from the same spec:

> These special behaviors are motivated by a desire for compatibility with two classes of legacy content: one that uses the presence of document.all as a way to detect legacy user agents, and one that only supports those legacy user agents and uses the document.all object without testing for its presence first.

### Question 18: Global regex

```js
const r = new RegExp("wtf", "gi");
r.test("wtf"); // true
r.test("wtf"); // ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
```

Correct answer: `false`

#### Explanation

Okay, so first things first.

There's something like **lastIndex**:

> [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/lastIndex):
>
> The **lastIndex** is a read/write integer property of regular expression instances that specifies the index at which to start the next match.

When we're using a global regex, methods *test* and *exec* will increase the **lastIndex** if the result is *true* (test) or *not null* (exec). Further calls of those functions will start searching the string from the **lastIndex**. Only when *test* returns **false** (or *exec* returns **null**), the **lastIndex** will be reset to 0.

This is what happens in the example:

1. **r.test("wtf");** ‚Äî **lastIndex** at first is 0, we found a substring matching the regex. **lastIndex** is updated to 3.
2. **r.test("wtf");** ‚Äî **lastIndex** is 3, and starting from the char of index 3, we get an empty string, so the result is false.

> [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test#Using_test()_on_a_regex_with_the_global_flag):
>
> Note: As long as test() returns true, lastIndex will not reset‚Äîeven when testing a different string!

### Question 19: Setting array properties

```js
const a = [1, 2, 3];
a[-1] = "wtf";
a[-1]; // ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
a[a.indexOf(-1)]; // ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
a[a.indexOf(100)]; // ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
```

Correct answer: `"wtf", "wtf", "wtf"`

#### Explanation

There's an [algorithm](http://es5.github.io/#x15.4.5.1) for defining arrays' properties.

Now, let's consider these three cases to see what the algorithm does:

1. **array[0] = 0** ‚Äî set first element of _array_ to be 0. <br />Result: **[0]**.

2. **array['1'] = 1** ‚Äî coerce **'1'** to a number and set first element of **array** to be 1. <br /> Result: **[0, 1]**.

3. **array['a'] = 'a'** ‚Äî **"a"** can't be coarced to a number, so it will add key-value to the **array**. <br /> Result: **[0, 1, a: 'a']**.

With **a[-1] = "wtf"** we have a case number 3, because **-1** is a negative number, thus can't be used as an index in array **a**. The array after this operation will look like this: **[1,2,3, -1: "wtf"]**.

**a[-1]** ‚Äî we just retrive a value for key **-1**, so the result is **"wtf"**.

**a[a.indexOf(-1)]** and **a[a.indexOf(100)]** ‚Äî *indexOf(x)* returns position of the array with element *x*, and -1 if there's no element *x* in the array. In our case there's no -1 or 100 in array **a**, so we have just **a[-1]** and **a[-1]**.

---

### Question 20: Array and object addition

```js
[] + {}; // ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
```

Correct answer: `"[object Object]"`

#### Explanation

JavaScript converts both left-hand side and right-hand side values to strings. For an empty array it results in an empty string, whereas a string version of an object is "[object Object]".
