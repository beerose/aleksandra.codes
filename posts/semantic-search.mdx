## Introduction

I was recently looking for a small AI-related side project and decided to
enhance my blog by adding a semantic search. Semantic search is a system that
can understand the meaning of words in documents and return results that are
more relevant to the user's intent.

With no prior AI knowledge and experience, and heavily inspired by
[YouTube semantic search](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/yt-semantic-search/tree/main/src/bin),
I used OpenAI and Pinecone and was able to quickly and easily build a semantic
search model for my blog that understands the meaning of the documents and
returns more relevant results. Itâ€™s been a nice exercise, Iâ€™ve learned some new
stuff (added a bunch of new words to my dictionary ðŸ˜…). I'm quite happy with the
results so Iâ€™m writing this post to go over the steps I took to achieve that.

Mistakes:

Steps:

1. Processing the content:

- go over all the blogposts
- get stuff like title and raw text (stripping the mdx stuff)

- split each blogpost into chunks
  - each chunk has 100 tokens
    - what is a token?
  - each chunk stores text, start, and end (could also store header)
- saving the (post, chunks) info in a file

2. Generating embeddings

- for each processed blog post
  - use OpenAI to create vector embeddings
    - what are embeddings
    - what are vectors

3. Upsert vectors to pinecone along with metadata

4. Query:

- create embedding for query
- send request to pinecone with the embedding
