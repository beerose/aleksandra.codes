# Abstract

We need our tooling to be set up like a well-oiled machine because the better
our process is the more value we can deliver. In this talk weâ€™re going to focus
on the speed of the TypeScript compiler and I'm going to show you how to debug
and optimise TypeScript performance. The less annoyance and fewer moments when
you want to throw your computer out of the window, the better!
