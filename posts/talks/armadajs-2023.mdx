# Abstract

We need our tooling to be set up like a well-oiled machine because the better
our process is the more value we can deliver. In this talk we‚Äôre going to focus
on the speed of the TypeScript compiler and I'm going to show you how to debug
and optimise TypeScript performance. The less annoyance and fewer moments when
you want to throw your computer out of the window, the better!

## What compiler compiles

### TypeScript program

An object that has all the compilation context.

### Scanner

Scans the source code and convert it into a list of tokens.

/>

### Parser

Brings context to the scanner. For example: it sees a `FunctionKeyword` so it
knows it‚Äôs gonna be a `FunctionDeclaration` and then if there‚Äôs an Identifier,
it‚Äôs gonna be this function Identifier, its name, and then we‚Äôre gonna have
parameters, and so on.

In reality, there's some back and forth communication between parser and lexer.
Parser is responsible for creating a correct AST, but it asks scanner to do some
extra reading. Parser controls the scanner.

### Binder

It results in errors about the whole context.

Main responsibilities:

- Creates a symbol table ‚Äî additional metadata for each node. It will be used
  for later phases. Has information on where identifiers are defined ‚Äî scopes.
  Keeps track of which scope you‚Äôre in (makes go to definition in IDE work).
- Sets up parent on syntax noes. Later checker can go up if needed and
  investigate the nodes above to get proper type.
- Makes flow nodes ‚Äî TS needs to keep track of scopes, what types occur where
  and where possible mutations occur.
- Validates script vs module conformance.

It‚Äôs a single run through the entire tree.

/>

### Checker

Includes most of the diagnostics. It‚Äôs huge. For everything in AST there are
checking functions like `checkVariableStatement`,
`checkGrammarVariableDeclarationList`, `isTypeRelatedTo`.

Two major responsibilities:

1. It checks if things are assignable to other things.
2. Type inference ‚Äî if there are ‚Äúgaps‚Äù, it tries to fill them ‚Äî this is why we
   store so much information with a binder.

### Transformer

It takes the AST that we have and to get JavaScript code, it strips all the
types and optionally applies some transformers to e.g. support modern syntax.

When creating an AST, TS keeps track of all the transformers that‚Äôs gonna be
needed. E.g. if it sees an ES2018 token and the target it older, it will know
that an ES2018 transformer will be needed.

And to get declaration files, it strips the code bit. DTS Transformer often asks
the type checker about the types. Especially when some variables are not
annotated.

### Emitter

We are getting the files that we requested.

## Debugging

It‚Äôs quite useful to see what‚Äôs going on ‚Äî what compiler steps are taking
significant amount of time.

The three most expensive steps are usually parsing, binding, and a checker.

### --listFiles

```
$ tsc --noEmit --listFiles | xargs stat -f "%z %N" | npx webtreemap-cli
```

### --showConfig

### ---generateTrace

```
$ tsc --generateTrace outDir
```

Tool to analyze trace:

```
$ npx @typescript/analyze-trace ./outDir
```

## Improving

### 1. Check tsconfig ‚Äî especially include/exclude settings

### 2. Name complex types

Examples:

- [ANT Design PR](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design-icons/pull/479)
- [ZOD PR](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod/pull/2107)

### 3. Make your types/code simpler

### 4. Help TypeScript skip inference (if you really need to)

- GraphQL Code Generator example

### 5. Be reasonable

So, my favourite thing ‚Äî a traceResolution flag. It makes it easier to identify
the parts of a program that are taking the most time to compile. It can tell you
which of your files to examine more closely.

- String literal templates example

### Use --incremental flag

### Still bad? Open an issue.
