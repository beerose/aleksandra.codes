## Abstract

This presentation will explore how AI makes code writing and development more
accessible and highlight the trend of malleable applications. Weâ€™ll see how
users are becoming architects of their own apps, reshaping them to suit their
needs. We will examine existing tools to understand the possibilities, and weâ€™ll
see how GraphQL fits there.
