## Abstract

This presentation will explore how AI is making code writing and development
more accessible and highlight the trend of malleable applications. Weâ€™ll see how
users are becoming architects of their own apps, reshaping them to suit their
needs. We will examine tools such as Notion or Arc to understand the
possibilities of user-developable applications. This will prompt a conversation
about how this shift in paradigm gives end-users the ability to shape their
software experiences.
