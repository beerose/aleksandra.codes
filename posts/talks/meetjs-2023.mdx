## Abstract

Have you ever asked yourself why JavaScript or other languages behave the way
they do? Have you ever come across syntax errors and wondered how it all works
under the hood? Or faced the challenge of creating custom DSL or ESLint rules
but found the world of visitors and ASTs intimidating? Let's explore that by
diving into the world of code transformers! By the end of this session, you'll
have a deeper understanding of programming languages and their underlying
mechanisms.
