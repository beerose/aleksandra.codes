## Abstract

With the rise of full-stack frameworks and the blurred line between frontend and
backend, it's becoming increasingly important to understand backend mechanics
well. This talk will dive into key backend concepts like webhooks, background
jobs, cron jobs, and more. These concepts are important for front-end
developers, especially as their applications become more complex. This talk will
provide you with guidance on when, how, and why you should integrate these
components into your projects.
