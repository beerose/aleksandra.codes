## Abstract

As full-stack frameworks continue to blur the lines between frontend and
backend, a solid grasp of backend mechanics becomes more vital for front-end
developers. In this talk, we'll dive into key backend concepts such as webhooks,
background jobs, and cron jobs, with a special emphasis on using these with full
type-safety. We'll explore how TypeScript's capabilities can enhance the
integration of backend components into your projects, providing a more robust
development environment.
