### Abstract

Did you know that some SQL variants are Turing complete and let you write any
program in SQL? Of course, no one's that crazy... But what are the limits of
SQL? What are some crazy things we can do with it? I'm going to go over a few of
them in this talk. It won't be only fun stuff, though! I'm going to show some
more practical but lesser-known concepts too. Let's discover some hidden SQL
traits together!
