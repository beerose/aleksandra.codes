#### CFP

**Elevator pitch**

Statically typed language? Sounds cool! Statically typed language and large
JavaScript codebase? Sounds like a lot of work... Learn how we evaluated our
options in Hasura and made the decision on which language to choose!

**Short summary**

We wanted to introduce a statically typed frontend language to the Hasura
Console for quite some time now. Recently we evaluated some options such as
PureScript, TypeScript, ReasonML, and Elm. We had the following points to
consider:

- We use React extensively, so we need something that goes with React well.
- Hasura Console has a pretty big codebase already, migration cost really
  matters.
- We want to enhance developer experience for us and for the external
  contributors.

During this talk, I'm going to show the pros and cons of the languages we
analyzed. I'll present how their adoption would look like and what catches we
would face along the way. I will also tell what we finally chose and which
aspects affected our decision the most.

#### Notes

**How will I deliver the talk?**

- Lecture
- Code snippets
- Charts, flowcharts

**What will I show?**

- Why bother about static typing. All the pros and cons of statically typed
  languages that need to be considered. In general. I won't focus on Hasura
  here.
- Why did we consider statically typed language?
- ReasonML — what, why, how
- TypeScript — what, why, how
- PureScript — what, why, how
- Elm — what, why, how
- Comparison between these languages — some charts: DX vs. Safety, from
  different perspectives, etc.
- Summary — what did we choose and why.

**What is the one thing I want people to learn?**

How to make the decision whether to adopt statically typed language. And which
one.

**Why?**

The decision is hard. I'd like to present what aspects are crucial and need to
be considered. I'll also show that you can give up on something to get something
else. There's no one best choice for each project.
