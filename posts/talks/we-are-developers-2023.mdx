## Abstract

Have you ever asked yourself why JavaScript or other languages behave the way
they do? Have you ever come across syntax errors and wondered how it all works
under the hood? Letâ€™s explore that by writing our own interpreter! It can be a
powerful and enlightening experience and provide an in-depth look into the
fundamentals of programming languages. This talk will explore the diverse
advantages of creating an interpreter, the resources and tools available to
assist you, and the steps needed to get started. By the end of this session,
you'll have a better understanding of programming languages and interpreters.
