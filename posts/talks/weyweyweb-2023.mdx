## Abstract

In this presentation, we will explore how AI is revolutionizing code writing and
development, making it more accessible to a wider audience. We will also
highlight the trend of malleable applications and how users are becoming
architects of their own apps, reshaping them to suit their needs. This shift in
paradigm gives end-users the ability to shape their software experiences, which
is an exciting development in the tech industry.

To understand the possibilities of user-developable applications, we will
examine tools such as Notion or Arc (and possibly more!). These tools offer
users the ability to create their own applications without needing to know how
to code. This is a game-changer for individuals and small businesses who may not
have the resources to hire developers.

During the presentation, we will start a conversation about this shift in
paradigm and how it impacts the software industry. We will discuss the
advantages and challenges of malleable applications and how they can benefit
both end-users and developers.

Overall, this presentation aims to showcase a possible future of software
development and how it is becoming more inclusive, accessible, and
user-friendly. I hope to inspire the audience to explore the possibilities of
user-developable applications and embrace this exciting shift in the industry.
