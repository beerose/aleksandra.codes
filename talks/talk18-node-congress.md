Blitz was created as a fullstack React framework, inspired by Ruby on Rails, and with a goal to make you as productive as possible! It features a ""Zero-API"" data layer abstraction, has authn & authz out of the box and a few more exciting features. However, we recently decided to pivot Blitz to a framework agnostic toolkit, which means a huge and thrilling change for the Blitz community. During this talk, I will introduce the core concepts, talk about the why & how of the pivot, and give you a glimpse of Blitz's future.
