#### How?

- Lecture
- Code snippets

#### What?

- What are higher rank types — semi formal definition (Rank 1 Types, Rank 2 Types)
- Possible use cases
- How it's not so easily done in Haskell
- How it's easily done in TypeScript
- Why you can't do it in Haskell (strong type inference)
- Why you can in TypeScript (week type inference)

#### Why?

- More like a fun fact
- Most of you probably haven't heard about it, but the same time most of you is using them on a daily basis
- Haskell vs TS

#### Agenda

**1. Intro**

**2. Why am I talking about Higher Rank Types?**

**3. What is it?**

**4. Higher ranks**

**5. Example**

**6. Haskell limitations**
